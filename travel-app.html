Once you begin looking into a destination you begin to realize all the extra planning that needs to go into before going which can take up to 10-20 hours (ie. room & lodging, rental vehicle, shuttle transport, activites, air fare, vaccinations, safety tips, etc.). 

                                                            Improving the travel planning process would be ideal and this application is a start in the right direction for travelers around the world.

He is overwhelmed at work and has a second to research where he wants to go. He comes across Travel Lynx and downloads it.  He determines exactly where he wants to go, finds all activities and housing he would like to stay at  how much is it going to cost, all safety tips he will need to know, and has it all stored on his device for easy management for when he needs to find any information regarding his trip instead of fumbling around trying to find his boarding pass check in number.

This would include rooms, activites, checking on safety tips, and being aware if there were any passport restrictions or vaccinations they would need to go.

The amount of research that goes into building a successful application is very important. The significance of research during the formation of the UX process became apparent to me while building this application. First, I conducted surveys and interviews to start this process. Once the surveys and interviews were completed I began building the wireframes to test the users to see if my application was a market fit. The initial wireframes worked well during user testing, but helped me understand that the application flow was not perfect. This process helped me understand how to increase the usability for users of the application and how to get the best experience for the user to easily flow through the application.  </p>

It is one of the most important quotes to encourage progress and aim for success in creating something that can be useful for users. This line can be used for almost anything but it is very clear this line fits perfectly for the UX/UI design process. It is not easy to create something but if you persevere and ask the right questions and execute on the right application features you may just find a market fit with your application.  </p>
